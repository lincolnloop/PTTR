      <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>

      <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Red Five standing by. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
